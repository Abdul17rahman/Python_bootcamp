# Section_6 Basics of Python

After covering all the installations for both windows, linux and mac as well as editors, we start with the basics of Python.
## Numbers
Pyhton represents numbers with 2 differents data types, ints (integers or whole numbers) and floats (real numbers or fractions). There is also complex numbers and longs.

In Python u can use the type(value) to get the type of the value.
## Operators
In Python, all the mathematical operators are available to perform operations.
### Below are the common operators
(+) - Addition
(-) - Subtraction
(*) - Multiplication
(/) - Division
(**) - Exponentiation
(%) - Modulo
(//) - Integer division => It doesnt care about the decimals or remiders

Note: Python respects the order of operation using PEMDAS (Paranthesis, Exponentials, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction).
## Comments
Comments are a way to write nodes inside code that wont run.

In Python we write comments in the following ways.
(#) - These are inline comments
(''' ''') - These are multi-line comments.
